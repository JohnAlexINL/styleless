# <style>less

Stop getting flashbanged by style-less websites!
This tiny extension detects websites that don't have
a `<link rel="stylesheet">` or `<style>` tag,
and then gives them a nice facelift.
Gone are the days of going read stuff
on some random developer's personal blog and suffering through the pain of
black text on a white screen spanning the entire width of your 4K monitor

You can either install it by just cloning the source
and then going into `chrome://extensions` > `Load Unpacked`,
or you can download the prebuilt `.crx` from
the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/JohnAlexINL/styleless/releases)
